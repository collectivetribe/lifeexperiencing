I belong to the jungle  

Where you belong to?  

Dear friend where you belong to?  

Coming from a place called France  

Where you going to?  

It’s a long way to here   

What you’re trying to do?   

Homeless at the park    

I know you Canadian  

But where you belong to?  

Singer on the stage  

People worship you  

But where you belong to?   

Mama earth   Mama earth   

Where we belong to?   

Mama earth   Mama earth   

Where we belong to?   

Were we all at there?   

Were we all there with you?
